My plan for this year is
to grow my social media presence a bit more. So to do this, I&amp;rsquo;ve created this blog.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper plan as to what I&amp;rsquo;ll post on here, but I do aim to post content
which I find beneficial, or things I have learnt. Although the majority of my work
is software development focused, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that all of my
posts will be related; they could just be tech related or things I found cool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I do know, is that I have a bunch of projects which I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting on
here from my old portfolio. My old portfolio is currently sat in limbo behind
the paywall which is Adobe so it would be good to revisit some of my older work!
Expect to see some of this work in the near future!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
