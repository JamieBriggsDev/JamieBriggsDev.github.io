When writing about a problem I had to solve, the post should be structured nicely. This template
highlights how best to structure the post.
---

# Introduction
- Introduce the problem
- Why was the problem introduced? (Was it for fun? Was there an actual issue at work?)
- Expectations of what I'll cover, and what the reader will learn.

> A few weeks ago, my team set up a fun challenge to stretch our skills: solve 
> [describe problem] using [tool/tech/method]. Here’s how I approached it, what 
> I learned, and what I’d do differently next time.

## The problem
- Explain the problem clearly.
- Include any constraints or rules. 
- Describe why it was interesting or difficult.

> The task was to [insert problem statement]. The catch? We could only use [limitation], and we 
> had to complete it within [timeframe/condition].

## Initial Thoughts & Plan
- Walk through how you initially thought about the problem.
- Did you make any assumptions?
- What was your plan of attack?

**Optional:** Show a diagram or sketch, or list of ideas

## Implementation
- Step through how you solved the problem
- Include code snippets, terminal outputs, screenshots, or visuals.
- Mention challenges or false starts, and how you handled them.

If this is getting long, or there's lots to talk about, break this down into sub sections.

## What didn't work
- Share bugs, dead ends, or approaches that failed
- This helps humanize your post and is super valuable to readers.

> At first, I tried [method], but it turned out to be a dead end because...

## Final Solution
- Present your final working solution
- Show the result/ output
- Compare it to your initial idea if it evolved
- Link to GitHub repo or code sandbox

## What I learned
- Highlight key takeaways, new skills, or surprising things.
- Mention any tools, libraries, or concepts you explored.

## What I'd do differently
- If you revisted the problem, what would you change?
- Are there better solutions you discovered later?

## Wrap up
- Sum up the experience
- Invite others to share their solutions or ask questions
- (Optional) suggest similar porblems or resources for readers.
